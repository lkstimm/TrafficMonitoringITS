## Overview

The architectural design of the Traffic Monitoring and Object Detection System is structured to facilitate real-time video processing and object detection using a modular approach. Each component is dedicated to a specific responsibility, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. The architecture leverages interfaces for communication between components, promoting flexibility and maintainability. The design adheres to best practices in software architecture, ensuring that the system meets performance and accuracy requirements while providing a user-friendly experience.

**Traceability:** ARCH traces UP to REQ and DOWN to DESIGN

## Architectural Patterns
