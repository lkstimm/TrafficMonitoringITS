## Overview

The architectural design of the Traffic Monitoring System is structured to facilitate real-time traffic monitoring through the integration of AI-powered object detection. The architecture is modular, with distinct components responsible for specific functionalities, ensuring maintainability and scalability. The system employs a service-oriented architecture, where the Traffic Monitor orchestrates the overall process, while utility components handle model loading, video processing, and environment setup. Interfaces between components are clearly defined to promote loose coupling and enhance reusability.

**Traceability:** ARCH traces UP to REQ and DOWN to DESIGN

## Architectural Patterns

- Service-Oriented Architecture
