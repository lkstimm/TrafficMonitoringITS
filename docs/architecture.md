## Overview

The architectural design of the Traffic Monitoring System is structured to facilitate real-time vehicle detection and classification through a modular approach. Each component is designed to handle specific responsibilities, ensuring separation of concerns and enhancing maintainability. The system employs a combination of services, handlers, and utilities to process video feeds, manage Regions of Interest (ROIs), log events, and deliver notifications to users. Interfaces between components are clearly defined to promote interaction and data flow, adhering to the principles of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and service-oriented architecture.

**Traceability:** ARCH traces UP to REQ and DOWN to DESIGN

## Architectural Patterns

- Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
